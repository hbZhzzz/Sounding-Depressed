# Sounding-Depressed

Here is the code for the paper "Sounding Depressed?Personalized Deep Learning Model for Depression Detection from Speech and Text".

Considering that our code is associated with some confidential projects that cannot be open-sourced at the moment, we are currently organizing and preparing the relevant parts of the code. Once the process is complete, we will make the code publicly available.
